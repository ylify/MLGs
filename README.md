Mollusca Linkage groups (N=20) constructed by the representative species from Conchifera and Aculifera, which enables researchers to investigate the chromosomal event in species with the chromosome-level genome.

In this version, seven genomes were employed in constructing the protein database via the guideline in Simakov et al. (Science Advances, 2022), including 1 snail (Gibbula magus), 1 bivalve (Mizuhopecten yessonensis), and 5 chitons (Acanthochitona rubrolineata, Acanthochitona discrepans, Callochiton septemvalvis, Deshayesiella sirenkoi, Liolophura japonica).
