# MLGs
Mollusca Linkage groups (N=20) constructed by the representative species from Conchifera and Aculifera, which enables researchers to investigate the chromosomal event in species with the chromosome-level genome.

In this version, seven genomes were employed in constructing the protein database via the guideline in *Science Advances* (Simakov et al., 2022), including 1 snail (*Gibbula magus*), 1 bivalve (*Mizuhopecten yessonensis*), and 5 chitons (*Acanthochitona rubrolineata*, *Acanthochitona discrepans*, *Callochiton septemvalvis*, *Deshayesiella sirenkoi*, *Liolophura japonica*). Specifically, only proteins were kept in the database if they were present at all seven species and also the best hit from each other. It consists of 4729 homologs (Mollusca_7sp.bed), with pseudo-locations (only for visualization, not the really gene order in ancestor) of them via the AGORA v3.1 (Muffato et al., 2023)
